This is a course project for Web Search and Mining which is used for search dblp.

This is a search engine for DBLP. After crawling all three types of pages, author pages, conference proceedings pages and journal pages from DBLP (totally near 2 million web pages), we parse the web pages and construct index based on Lucene, a free and open-source information retrieval software library. Our search system is developed with high performance and support real-time key word queries.
